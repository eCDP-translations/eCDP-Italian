# eCrew Development Program (eCDP) Italian Translation
This is a repository of the Italian translation of McDonald's [eCrew Development Program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECrew_Development_Program).

Original repo and scripts are taken from [eCDP-English](https://github.com/eCDP-English/translation).

## Requirements
1. [Python3.9+](https://www.python.org/downloads/), if unsure download the latest version
2. An original, unmodified ROM of McDonald's eCDP (SHA-1: `136aacc9d3d7c8567381cd4e735ff3c004a018d0`)
3. (optional) Git

## Usage
This guide is for patching all translations to your ROM. For patching individual sections, please check instructions inside corresponding directories.

0. Clone [or download](https://github.com/eCDP-translations/eCDP-Italian/archive/refs/heads/master.zip) this repository
```
git clone https://github.com/eCDP-translations/eCDP-Italian.git
```
1. (Optional) Create a new virtual environment and activate it. If unsure, skip this step.
2. Run  `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Place the NDS file into the root of this repository. The file could be named as you please, but through the guide, for the sake of simplicity, we'll refer to it as "eCDP.nds"
4. Run `patch_all.py` with the desired language code and ROM file specified

For any language, the command is:
```
python patch_all.py -l [LANG_CODE] eCDP.nds
```

For the Italian language, the command is:
```
python patch_all.py -l it eCDP.nds
```
5. The script will patch strings of all sections, and it will create a file named `\<ROM Filename\>-patched.nds`.
