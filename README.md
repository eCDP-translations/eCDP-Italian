# eCrew Development Program (eCDP) Italian Translation
This is a repository of the Italian translation of McDonald's [eCrew Development Program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECrew_Development_Program).

Original repo and scripts are taken from [eCDP-English](https://github.com/eCDP-English/translation).

## Usage
1. Grab an original, unmodified ROM of McDonald's eCDP (SHA-1: `136aacc9d3d7c8567381cd4e735ff3c004a018d0`)
2. Download the [latest xdelta patch](https://github.com/eCDP-translations/eCDP-Italian/releases/download/v1.0.0/eCDP_Italian_v_1_0_0.xdelta)
3. Download [XDelta patcher](https://www.romhacking.net/download/utilities/704/) and place it into a folder.
