    "■When taking out raw food, check\nthe shelf life and use the ones\nwith the oldest non-expired date\nfirst.",
    "■Arranging raw food incorrectly\ncan cause older food to expire\nbefore it can be used, wasting\nit unnecessarily and affecting\nstore costs.",
    "■Check the quality of raw food\nitems and discard any that do\nnot meet quality standards.\n■Each store has rules for\nstoring raw food. Therefore,\nconsult with your manager first."
